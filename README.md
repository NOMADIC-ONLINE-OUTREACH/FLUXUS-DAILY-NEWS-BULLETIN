Regurgitated from like one conversation

* 1. Collect news headlines (NewsAPI)
* 2a. Feed into GAN (machine learning neural network) and turn the results into a headline generator when given the inputs of news headlines
* 2b. Alternatively: Find a sentence-completion system you can plug into the site or a back-end sever thing (it's possible to do these steps in R but then getting it into the site is another question) 
* 3. Display the headlines, with whatever style you care to muster
