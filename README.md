daily bulletin reverse-engineering the global absurd





# methodology

Regurgitated from like one conversation

* 1. Collect news headlines (NewsAPI)

* 2a. Feed into GAN (machine learning neural network) and turn the results into a headline generator when given the inputs of news headlines
* 2b. Alternatively: Find a sentence-completion system you can plug into the site or a back-end sever thing (it's possible to do these steps in R but then getting it into the site is another question) 
* 2c. LAZYTOWN EDITION: pluck terms out, toss em in a bag, pull out a few at a time and make a sentence. Maybe have some random words from our own set mixed in.


* 3. Display the headlines, with whatever style you care to muster
